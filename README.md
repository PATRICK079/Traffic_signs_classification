# üõë German Traffic Sign Classification with Deep Learning

This project demonstrates the development of a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify traffic signs 

The focus is on building a **robust, reliable model** that can accurately recognize 43 traffic sign classes, supporting safe decision-making in real-world applications such as autonomous vehicles.

## üéØ Objectives

- Build a high-performance image classification model for traffic signs.
- Implement thorough preprocessing: grayscale conversion, histogram equalization, normalization.
- Address class imbalance and improve generalization through data augmentation.
- Evaluate model performance on training, validation, and test sets.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters to improve accuracy and reliability.

## üìä Results

Before fine tuning, the model achieved:

- **Validation Accuracy:** ~97%
- **Test Accuracy:** ~93%

After multiple iterations and fine-tuning, the final model achieved:

- **Validation Accuracy:** ~99%
- **Test Accuracy:** ~96%

This demonstrates strong generalization and suitability for real-world datasets.

## üß™ Example Testing Observations

Initially, the model correctly predicted 3 out of 5 random traffic images, highlighting areas for improvement.  
After hyperparameter tuning and data augmentation, the model classified **all samples correctly**, showcasing significantly improved robustness.
